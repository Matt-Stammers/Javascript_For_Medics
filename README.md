An Introduction to Javascript for Clinician Developers

If you want to become a Frontend web developer then there is one more technology that you need to master - Javascript. Javascript is the technology that powers the web, anything that moves or interacts with the user or changes colour or does just about anything dynamic is going to be run by Javascript. You can use it to make games, web apps and in fact entire massive websites. It is probably the most popular programming language around today, and for good reason as it comes with a vast array of libraries, packages and frameworks (These things basically make it a lot easier to do stuff which is cool as a developer because time is your most precious asset.)

Before you get started I recommend you download the Atom text editor: https://atom.io/ as it is definitely the best frontend coding environment I have found (and I have tried out a LOT of them!). It will allow you to keep all your code tidy and help highlight any issues + it features certain predictive abilities which are not to be overlooked.

I also recommend the following resources to learn Javascript:

Sololearn App - www.sololearn.com - enables you to code on the go.
Codeacademy - www.codeacademy.com
Many of the courses on Udemy / Udacity / or any of the other major platforms are very good, but don't pay for one to learn CSS alone.

There are also numerous web based games that can teach you to code - particularly frontend based ones: https://skillcrush.com/2017/04/03/free-coding-games/

Eloquent javascript (free) - http://eloquentjavascript.net/ - can be a little bit intense in the later chapters, but extremely cogent and comprehensive 

Javascript30.com (free) - I also really like this javascript30 course by Wes Bos who also has courses on React, ES6, CSS flexbox etc. The focus in this course is manipulating the browser DOM with javascript to create cool animations and interactivity - it is very good in general for learning the new javascript syntax (Ecmascript 6, or ES6) 

There is an increasing movement of using javascript on the Server side too. There are numerous methods for doing this, but most are based around Node.js, an engine for running server-side javascript. Then there are various fullstack javascript frameworks including Meteor.js and the MEAN or MERN stacks (MongoDB, Express, Angular/React, Node.js).

Udemy Node.js course (not free) - https://www.udemy.com/understand-nodejs/learn/v4/ - For learning server side javascript, I recommend this node.js course on udemy 

If you want to learn Meteor (my personal framework of choice), start with the Meteor tutorial:
https://www.meteor.com/tutorials
Meteor is built on node.js so understanding node is very useful for understanding and using meteor better - you can now download and use npm modules/libraries directly in meteor projects.

Specific to meteor, once you have done the Meteor tutorial, I would recommend:
http://meteortips.com/first-meteor-tutorial/ (free) - this site looks basic, but it was the key to me really understanding what was going on in meteor. There are two parts, both worth doing.

The guy who runs LevelUpTuts on Youtube is another brilliant one, but some of these use the old meteor structure (still worth doing, as the new structure is only a change in how files are laid out to be honest)
- I really like his intermediate tutorial on recipes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI8IslJHSag&list=PLLnpHn493BHFYZUSK62aVycgcAouqBt7V (old structure)
- he has other tutorials to, that take you through the new structure (meteor 1.4): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFNX6riJtcc&list=PLLnpHn493BHGaNQgSl1lppoNrpjlr24z5
He also has tutorials on React frontend instead of Blaze (the inbuilt view engine for Meteor). I still use Blaze, but React is on my list of things to learn and is meant to be an awesome way of developing.

http://javascriptissexy.com/learn-meteor-js-properly/ - this has a really comprehensive run down of the reason for meteor and other advice

A note of advice: be patient with yourself, it takes time especially when working full time as a doctor. It took me months to get going, but trust me it is well worth it and you will never regret the investment you made in yourself ;)

After you master Javascript I guarantee you will be hooked and won't be able to look back. This is the point where a lot of people give up, but if you can get past this part you really start to reap the rewards ;)

If you have any questions just message me on facebook or join the clinical developers email list and send me a direct mail from there.

Happy coding!
